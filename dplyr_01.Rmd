This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

#### Set up R environment

Install tidyverse and hflights package. "hflights" is described on CRAN as "A data only package containing commercial domestic flights that departed Houston (IAH and HOU) in 2011."
```{r}
# install.packages("hflights")  # data


# load packages
library("rmarkdown")
library("dplyr")
library("hflights")             # data
```



#### Get acquainted with the dataset.
```{r}
str(hflights)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

```{r}


```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
